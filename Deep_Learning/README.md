# BS6204 Deep Learning for Biomedical Science

### Sypnosis  

First and foremost, I would like to thank Olivia and Max for contributing to this project or attempt to generate a deep learning model to predict for effective Cas13a guide RNAs. It was much harder than anticipated. We had trouble finding a good normalisation method as explained in the report for BS6203 due to noise in the experimental repeats. We've tried various models such as Bi-LSTM, MLP and Conv2D, and various inputs including different target mRNA length (Upstream and downstream region of the target), predicted crRNA folding generated from RNAfold and unpaired probability of the target region generated from RNAplfold. We found Conv2d to work best for our purpose. We also found that if the input is a one-hot encoding of the target region, the models tend to overfit due to (possibly) large amount of noise. The model performed better when we added predicted crRNA folding and unpaired probability as inputs, in addition to the sequence, with an accuracy of 60%. The code is quite all over due to adjustment of guide score relatively late into the project (different normalization method) but it should be relatively simple to follow through. Report is attached in the report folder.
