# Cas13AgRNAtor

Code Repository for projects under NTU Masters in Biomedical Data Science for the following courseworks:
- BS6203 Story-telling with Graphics and Visualisations (Plotting)
- BS6204 Deep Learning for Biomedical Science (Deep_Learning)

## Synopsis 

First and foremost, I would like to thank Denise under BS6203, and Max and Olivia under BS6204 for their valuable contribution to this attempt and project. The project is titled Cas13AgRNAtor (Cas13a guide RNA generator). The end goal was to build a machine learning or deep learning model (BS6204) to predict for effective Cas13a gRNAs using raw data obtained from Abudayyeh et al. We attempted to find potential features via the aid of graphics and visualiztion in BS6203 (more information in Plotting). We attempted to build a Deep Learning Model in BS6204 (more information in Deep_Learning). The machine learning project is still an open project for anyone to attempt.
